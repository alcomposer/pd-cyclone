[spray] accepts lists where the 1st value indicates the outlet number (starting at 0) and the 2nd element (float or symbol) is sent to that outlet - when not in list mode, subsequent elements are sent to subsequent outlets to the right, other wise (in list mode) the whole list is output at that outlet.
